**WORK EXPERIENCE**

* Sr. Algorithm engineer in Huawei since September 2019 to NOW
  * Main activities and responsibilities:
      optimization algorithms (image processing, ANN), investigate new techologies/tools/frameworks which may be useful, enabling new functionality in optimization framewrks.
  * Project description:
      hidden.
  * Used skills:
      * Languages: C/C++, Python.
      * IDE/Build systems/tools: Visual Studio (build tools), Android Studio, CMake, Ninja, Python, GIT, GitLab.
      * Other: great experience in working with existing code (rework algorithms), implementation / debug multi thread code and vectorization, optimization for GPU (OpenCL, CUDA, Halide, NEON) native C++ on Android, using dynamic libraries (Windows and Ubuntu as host OS).
  * Key accomplishments: hidden. Some related public materials - https://github.com/akokoshn/Halide/wiki/Scheduling:-simple-examples-&-workarounds.
* Software Developer in Intel since September 2014 to June 2019
  * Main activities and responsibilities: develop features, fix bugs, communication with customers / stack holders
  * Project description: media library for work with video: decoding, encoding, video processing, target on performance (MSDK) – cross platform  (Windows, Linux, Android) dynamic library,  middle ware between application and driver which provide API for execute decode/encode/vp on Intel integrated GPU.
  * Used skills:
      * Languages: C/C++, Java, C#, Perl.
      * IDE/Build systems/tools: Visual Studio, Android Studio, CMake, Ninja, Python, GIT, Intel VTune, GPUView.
      * Other: great experience in  working with existing code, implementation / debug multi thread code, native C++ on Android, using dynamic libraries on different OS.
  * Key accomplishments: Implement features required for new release or customer request, for example: enabled support new codecs, added processing steps (resize, color conversion, etc), improved performance via new way of memory allocation / found and avoided extra copy. Worked with customers, including investigation / fix issue, helped correct integrate product, discuss and implemented feature requests. Related GitHub project: https://github.com/Intel-Media-SDK/MediaSDK.
* Summer School (like intern for 2 moth) in Intel since Jun 2014 to August 2014
  * Main activities and responsibilities: implementation of probability cache model.
  * Project description: predict cache misses on any HW platform for application based on trace collected on one platform. It’s simulator which used probability model.
  * Used skills:
      * Languages: C/C++, JS, Python.
      * IDE/Build systems/tools: Visual Studio, Python, SVN, Intel VTune.
  * Key accomplishments: enabled base functionality, was used as prove of concept.

**EDUCATION AND TRAINING**
  * **Master degree in Lobachevsky University (UNN) (2012 - 2018).** Fundamental information technology, IITMM (CMC  - calculation math and cybernetic). Specialized on computer graphic.

**PERSONAL SKILLS AND COMPETENCES**


The most part of experience related to real time image and video processiong, including encode / decode by H264, H265, VP9, VP8, MPEG, ... Target on performance, so used different types of optimization like moving part of pipeline to GPU, vectorization, etc.

* Technical Skills
    * OS:
        * Windows: developing dynamic libraries and applications which include using WIN API, cross process communication, multy threading, have experience in cross platform build.
        * Ubuntu: developing dynamic libraries and applications, cross process communication, multy threading, have experience in cross platform build.
        * Android: developing dynamic libraries, native applications, normal applications, services (codecs for Codec 2.0), cross process communication, multy threading, have experience in cross platform build.
    * Program Languages:
        * C/C++: main language, usin on current work, used in MSDK project (Intel).
        * C#: wrote samples and gui of debug tool (library calls tracer) for MSDK project, used in university (just simple gui applications).
        * Java: debug android application for MSDK project.
        * Python: wrote build framework and samples (using TensorRT) for Huawei projects.
        * Perl: debug test for MSDK project.
        * Java Script: non comercial using (small games)
        * PHP: non comercial using at university.
    * Technology:
        * Open GL.
